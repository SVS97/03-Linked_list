# Linked list library

### Realization
*Library* consist of 3 files:
1. **list.c** is a main-file for work with linked list
2. **linkedListLib.h** is a Header-file for operations with linked list
3. **linkedListLib.c.** is a Implementations of functions for work with linked list

**_Library_** include next operations:
1. linked_list_clear – 			make the list empty
2. linked_list_tail_add – 		appends one element to the end of the list
3. linked_list_insert – 		put node at exact position in the list
4. linked_list_remove – 		removes node from list
5. linked_list_count_identical – 	returns the number of elements in a list, which are equal to the given one
6. linked_list_reverse – 		reverse the order of items in the list
7. linked_list_sort – 			given the compare function sorts list items (ascending or descending)
